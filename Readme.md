# An Discord RPG-Bot developed in Typescript

### Getting started with typescript

I've never done a real TypeScript project so far, so I decided to setup a simple project for a discord bot.
Here should emerge a funny text based RPG that allows different actions and character progression.

## Planned Features

### mechanics

- simple combat calculation based on players attributes, equipment and a bit of Luck
- inventory-, loot- & economy systems
- progression (level up and improve skills)

### Actions

- Huntig
- Shoping
- Playerduells
